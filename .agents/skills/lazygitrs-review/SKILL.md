# Lazygitrs Review Notes Skill

## Overview

This skill enables AI coding agents (opencode, codex, gemini, etc.) to participate in a bidirectional review-notes workflow with **lazygitrs**, a Rust TUI for git.

lazygitrs runs an embedded HTTP server on a dynamic port (defaults to `47657`). The active port is written to `.lazygitrs.port`. 
**CRITICAL**: Before running any of the curl commands below, ALWAYS determine the port by running `PORT=$(cat .lazygitrs.port 2>/dev/null || echo 47657)`. The commands below use `$PORT` as a placeholder.

The user creates inline notes in the diff view, sends them to your AI session, and you respond by posting annotations back.

## Architecture

```
User (TUI)                     AI CLI (you)
   │                               │
   │  press S on a note            │
   │  ──SSE event push──►          │  (or spawn subprocess fallback)
   │  {note-sent, file, line}      │
   │                               │
   │             ◄──curl GET────   │  fetch user notes
   │                               │
   │  ◄──curl POST (annotations)── │  push your review
   │                               │
   │  notes appear in TUI          │
```

### SSE (Server-Sent Events) — preferred notification method

lazygitrs pushes `note-sent` events in real-time to any connected AI CLI. Connect with:

```bash
PORT=$(cat .lazygitrs.port 2>/dev/null || echo 47657)
curl -N http://127.0.0.1:$PORT/session-api/events
```

This keeps a long-lived connection open. When the user presses `S`, you'll receive:

```
data: {"type":"note-sent","noteId":"...","file":"src/main.rs","line":10,"note":"...","prompt":"..."}
```

Parse the JSON, fetch all notes, review the code, and post your annotations back.

If no SSE clients are connected when `S` is pressed, lazygitrs falls back to spawning the `notifyCommand` or pushing to the `serverUrl`.

## Universal AI Integration Architecture

lazygitrs is built to be completely agnostic to the AI tool you are using. It supports three distinct transport layers to wake up the AI when the user presses `S` on a note:

1. **Subprocess Spawning (`notifyCommand`)**:
   - Best for CLI tools like `agy` (Antigravity), `claude` (Claude Code), etc.
   - lazygitrs spawns a background shell process, passing the prompt as an argument. The CLI then routes the message to the correct session.
2. **HTTP Push (`serverUrl`)**:
   - Best for tools running a local background server, like `opencode`.
   - lazygitrs does an instant HTTP POST directly to the local server, injecting the prompt directly into the active TUI.
3. **Server-Sent Events (`SSE`)**:
   - Best for custom wrapper scripts or IDE extensions.
   - AI tools can subscribe to `GET /session-api/events` and stream events in real-time.

You configure which architecture your AI uses during the **registration** step.

## API Endpoints

### Register your session ID (do this first!)

When your AI session starts, register your session ID so lazygitrs can target you when the user presses `S`:

```bash
# Example for Antigravity (agy): Use your REAL internal Conversation ID!
PORT=$(cat .lazygitrs.port 2>/dev/null || echo 47657)
curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:$PORT/session-api \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  --data '{"action":"register","sessionId":"YOUR_REAL_CONVERSATION_ID","cli":"antigravity","notifyCommand":"/home/fecavmi/.local/bin/agy --conversation {{session_id}} --print {{prompt}}"}'

# Example for opencode:
PORT=$(cat .lazygitrs.port 2>/dev/null || echo 47657)
curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:$PORT/session-api \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  --data '{"action":"register","sessionId":"YOUR_SESSION_ID","cli":"opencode","serverUrl":"http://127.0.0.1:4096","notifyCommand":"opencode run --continue {{prompt}}"}'
```

**CRITICAL**: You must use your *real*, unique conversation ID (e.g., your Antigravity conversation UUID) as the `sessionId`, and you must provide the correct `notifyCommand` for your CLI. If you use a fake/mock ID, background notifications spawned by lazygitrs will not know how to route messages back to your active chat window!

The `cli` field is optional but helps identify which AI tool is registered. The `serverUrl` enables direct inline prompt pushing if your AI CLI runs a local web server. The `notifyCommand` is a shell command template that lazygitrs spawns when the user presses `S` (use `{{session_id}}` and `{{prompt}}` placeholders). The session ID and command are persisted to `.lines.json` so they survive lazygitrs restarts.

**Session conflict:** If another session is already registered, the register call returns `{"status":"conflict"}` instead of overwriting. To force overwrite, add `"force": true` to the payload. To clear the existing session first, use the `unregister` action.

#### opencode inline push (recommended)

If you're running **opencode**, include `serverUrl` in the register call. opencode runs a built-in HTTP server (default port 4096). When `serverUrl` is set, lazygitrs pushes the review prompt **directly into your running TUI** via `POST /tui/append-prompt` + `POST /tui/submit-prompt` — no new process, fully inline.

Start opencode with a fixed port:
```bash
opencode --port 4096
```

Then register:
```bash
PORT=$(cat .lazygitrs.port 2>/dev/null || echo 47657)
curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:$PORT/session-api \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  --data '{"action":"register","sessionId":"opencode-session-001","cli":"opencode","serverUrl":"http://127.0.0.1:4096"}'
```

#### Other AI CLIs

If your CLI doesn't have a TUI API, omit `serverUrl`. lazygitrs will try SSE next, then fall back to spawning `notifyCommand`.

For opencode, you can get your session ID with:
```bash
opencode session list --format json 2>/dev/null | head -1
```

Or just use `--continue` in the notifyCommand template (no session ID needed):
```yaml
notifyCommand: "opencode run --continue {{prompt}}"
```

To check the currently registered session:
```bash
PORT=$(cat .lazygitrs.port 2>/dev/null || echo 47657)
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:$PORT/session-api/session
```

To unregister (on exit):
```bash
PORT=$(cat .lazygitrs.port 2>/dev/null || echo 47657)
curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:$PORT/session-api \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  --data '{"action":"unregister"}'
```

### Fetch all notes

```bash
PORT=$(cat .lazygitrs.port 2>/dev/null || echo 47657)
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:$PORT/session-api/notes
```

Response:
```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "revision": 5,
  "session": {
    "sessionId": "opencode-session-001",
    "cli": "opencode"
  },
  "notes": [
    {
      "id": "src/main.rs-10-New-1234567890",
      "file": "src/main.rs",
      "line": 10,
      "panel": "New",
      "comment": "Consider caching this regex.",
      "source": "user",
      "author": "user",
      "createdAt": "2026-06-26T10:00:00.000Z",
      "status": "sent",
      "tags": []
    }
  ]
}
```

### Fetch notes for a specific file

```bash
PORT=$(cat .lazygitrs.port 2>/dev/null || echo 47657)
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:$PORT/session-api/notes/src%2Fmain.rs
```

### List notes (POST alternative)

```bash
PORT=$(cat .lazygitrs.port 2>/dev/null || echo 47657)
curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:$PORT/session-api \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  --data '{"action":"list"}'
```

### Navigate to a Note or Line

Forces the TUI to focus on a specific file, scroll to the requested line, and highlight any note intersecting that line.
By default, this collapses all other files. To preserve the unified view of all diffs, set `"combinedView": true`.

```bash
PORT=$(cat .lazygitrs.port 2>/dev/null || echo 47657)
curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:$PORT/session-api \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "action": "navigate",
    "filePath": "src/main.rs",
    "side": "new",
    "line": 10,
    "combinedView": true
  }'
```

### Push review annotations

```bash
PORT=$(cat .lazygitrs.port 2>/dev/null || echo 47657)
curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:$PORT/session-api \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "version": 1,
    "summary": "Reviewed the auth refactor",
    "files": [
      {
        "path": "src/main.rs",
        "summary": "One concern about the token validation logic.",
        "annotations": [
          {
            "id": "review-note-1",
            "newRange": [10, 10],
            "summary": "Cache the compiled regex.",
            "rationale": "The token pattern is rebuilt on every request; compiling it once would reduce GC pressure.",
            "tags": ["performance"],
            "confidence": "medium",
            "author": "sonnet"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }'
```

## Annotation Fields

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `summary` | Yes | Short description of the review note |
| `rationale` | No | Detailed explanation |
| `newRange` | One of | `[startLine, endLine]` on the new side |
| `oldRange` | one of | `[startLine, endLine]` on the old side |
| `id` | No | Unique id (auto-generated if omitted) |
| `tags` | No | Array of category strings (`["security", "performance"]`) |
| `confidence` | No | `"low"`, `"medium"`, or `"high"` |
| `author` | No | Who wrote the annotation (e.g. `"sonnet"`) |
| `createdAt` | No | ISO 8601 timestamp (auto-set if omitted) |

## Note Status Lifecycle

User notes go through these statuses:

1. **`new`** — User created the note but hasn't sent it to AI
2. **`sent`** — User pressed `S`, AI session was notified via subprocess
3. **`addressed`** — AI posted annotations on the same file+line

When you POST annotations for a file+line that has a user note with `status: "sent"`, lazygitrs automatically marks that user note as `addressed`.

## Workflow

1. **Receive notification**: The user presses `S` on a note in lazygitrs. Your AI session receives a prompt telling you to check the notes endpoint.

2. **Fetch notes**: Run `PORT=$(cat .lazygitrs.port 2>/dev/null || echo 47657) && curl -s http://127.0.0.1:$PORT/session-api/notes` to see all user review notes. Filter for `status: "sent"` to find notes awaiting your response.

3. **Review the code**: Read the files and lines referenced by the notes. Understand the user's concern.

4. **Post your response**: Use `curl -X POST` to push your annotations back. Match the `file` and `line` from the user's note so lazygitrs can mark it as `addressed`.

5. **Verify**: Fetch notes again to confirm the user's note status changed to `addressed`.

## Tips

- **Important**: Only create annotations on files that have active git modifications (or staged changes). lazygitrs will only display annotations that intersect with the diff view. Creating notes on unmodified files will result in them not being visible.
- Always include `newRange` or `oldRange` so your annotation appears on the correct line in the diff view
- Use `newRange` for lines that exist in the new version of the file, `oldRange` for deleted lines
- Line numbers are 1-based file line numbers (not diff hunk line numbers)
- The `revision` counter in the response increments on every change — you can poll and compare to detect new notes efficiently
